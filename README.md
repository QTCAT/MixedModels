# relMM

An R package for (Generalized) Linear Mixed Models (G)LMM incorporating user 
defined 'G-site' covariance relationship matrices. Derived from 'pedigreemm'.

This package is for my own research to get things done. Therefore it is not 
tested in a wide range of possible applications, but only for those related to 
my own work. This means, that you should use it only with care and if you know 
what you are doing!
