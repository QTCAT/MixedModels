# relMM

An R package for (Generalized) Linear Mixed Models (G)LMM incopareting user 
defined 'G-site' covariance relationship matrices. Derifed from 'pedigreemm'.

This package is for my own research to get things done. Therefore it is not 
tested in a wide range of possible applications, but only for those related to 
my work. This means, that you should use it only with care and if you know what 
you are doing!
